**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND WILL NOT WORK.**

Is a sim really getting on your nerves? Can't stand having them in your game anymore? Worry no more! Simocide takes care of this need by adding a command to instantly kill any sim you wish (so long as they're on the current lot).

How to use
----------
1) Open up the cheat console (ctrl+shift+c)
2) Type: `kill first_name last_name`
3) Enjoy!

How to install
-------------
Simply drag Simocide.zip into your mods folder (Don't extract it!)
